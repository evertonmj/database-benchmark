# Database Benchmarking: Redis vs Memcached

This project performs a benchmarking comparison between **Redis** and **Memcached** for key-value store operations. By using sample data and executing read/write operations against both databases, it provides insights into performance differences based on factors such as dataset size and operation complexity.

## Features

- **Key-Value Store Benchmarking**: Benchmarks read and write operations in Redis and Memcached.
- **Dataset Loading**: Dynamically generates data and loads it directly into Redis and Memcached.
- **Performance Measurement**: Compares execution time for read and write operations on both databases.
- **Multi-threaded Execution** (future improvement): Analyze performance under concurrent operation loads.

---

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the following libraries and technologies:

- **Java 21**: Core programming language for application logic.
- **Redis**: Used for key-value store operations.
    - Library: [Jedis](https://github.com/redis/jedis) for Redis CLI interaction.
- **Memcached**: Used for key-value store operations.
    - Library: [spymemcached](https://github.com/couchbase/spymemcached) for Memcached interaction.
- **Loggers**: Java's `java.util.logging` for logging messages (recommendation: use SLF4J/Logback for advanced features).

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Install JDK 21 or higher.
    - [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
2. **Redis**: Ensure Redis is installed and running.
    - Default Host: `127.0.0.1`
    - Default Port: `6379`
3. **Memcached**: Ensure Memcached is installed and running.
    - Default Host: `127.0.0.1`
    - Default Port: `11211`
4. **Maven** (optional): Required if the project uses Maven to manage dependencies.

---

### Configuration

Update the Redis and Memcached connection parameters in your code as follows:

- **Redis Configuration**:
  ```java
  private static final String REDIS_HOST = "127.0.0.1";
  private static final int REDIS_PORT = 6379;
  ```
- **Memcached Configuration**:
  ```java
  private static final String MEMCACHED_HOST = "127.0.0.1";
  private static final int MEMCACHED_PORT = 11211;
  ```

Alternatively, externalize these configurations to a `config.properties` file or environment variables for better maintainability.

---

## Usage

### 1. Load Data

Run the application, and it will generate your dataset and load it into both Redis and Memcached databases.

```bash
java -jar database-benchmark.jar
```

### 2. Perform Benchmarking

The program will execute and measure the following for each database:
- Read and write operations using sample data.
- Operation execution time comparison between Redis and Memcached.

Sample usage in the code:
```java
KeyValueBenchmark.performBenchmark();
```

### 3. View Results

Results are printed in the console. Optionally, you can enhance this to write to a log file or an external analytics dashboard.

---

## Benchmark Framework

The benchmarking process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Populate databases with randomly generated entries.
   - Redis: Uses Jedis to store and retrieve data.
   - Memcached: Uses spymemcached to store and retrieve data.
2. **Operation Execution**: Measure execution times for read and write operations for both databases using sample data.

---

## Planned Improvements

The following improvements are under consideration:

1. **Multi-threaded Concurrency Testing**:
   - Simulate multiple concurrent operations to analyze performance under load.
2. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Integrate connection pools (e.g., JedisPool for Redis) into database connection logic.
3. **Benchmark Visualization**:
   - Create a visual representation (charts/tables) of benchmark results.
4. **Refactoring**:
   - Split responsibilities across multiple classes (e.g., RedisUtility, MemcachedUtility) to align with clean code practices.
5. **Testing Framework**:
   - Add unit and integration tests to validate functionality.
6. **External Configuration Management**:
   - Support configuration files or environment variables for database connection settings.
